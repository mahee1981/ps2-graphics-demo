## PS2 GRAPHICS DEMO

This repository has been set up to track code changes to my personal PS2 graphics C++ interface. It can serve also as a reference for learning graphics on PS2.

Milestones:
 - Successfully initialized PS2 Graphics Synthesizer
 - Rendered a Gouraud shaded triangle
 - TODO: Math on EE core and VU0
 - TODO: Model, View and Projection matrices
 - TODO: Texture loading
